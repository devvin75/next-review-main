__Hellblade__ Each day in Stardew Valley takes around 10 to 20 real minutes, and several of them are occupied by the slow business of starting a farm from scratch. Having to plant the right seeds, water your crops, and wait for the harvest before making any real money means there’s not a lot to do right away. Fitting, since my character had just left a stifling job at the Joja Corporation — Stardew Valley’s ever-present reminder that capitalism can grow soulless — for a simpler life on grandpa’s old farm. But Stardew Valley isn’t simple. It’s relaxed, sure, and lets you grow at your own pace, but it’s a rich world once you get past the slow first season.
